Game Rock, Paper and Scissors

At the firt part of this project I should make two function to beggin the game. The first one should asked to the user to chose rock, paer or scissors and the dsecond one will bring the computer choose. For the computer choise I used the math.random method, to returns a random number from 0 to 2 and then with the condicionals converted the number in rock, paper or scissors.
After this the third function will bring which one was the winner and the score to every round, for this game the user and the computer should play for 5 times.
